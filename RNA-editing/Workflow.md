# RNA-editing principles and analyze
## YF
RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification of RNA, the transcripts will be edited and make a different transcript, further affecting gene expression. Some common type in RNA editing including, **A-to-I** (adenosine-to-inosine) and **C-to-U** (cytosine-to-uracil) etc. This edition action is mainly conducted by RNA deaminases, such as Apobec1 and ADAR2. RNA-seq will be utilize to capture the sequencing, and variant calling can be applied for processed data.
