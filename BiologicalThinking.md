# Teminologies in bioinformatics and genetics world
> this page is my notes of some terminologies and useful hints for research, more focusing on biological aspect

## Cis-regulatory elements
DNA sequences, including enhancers, promoters located on the same chromosome as the gene they regulate, while trans occur when the regulatory elements come from a different chromosome or location.

## B cell
B cells are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in the immune system, can undergo a process called class-switch recombination, changes the type of antibody they produce.

## Gene body
entire region of a gene, all the DNA sequences

## hybrid-binding domain
specific region or part of a protein that has the ability to recognaize and bind to hybrid structure.

## DMS for secondary structure
DMS is dimethyl sulfate, a chemical reagent reacting with A and C in single-stranded, provides information to check which bases are involved in base-pairing which are exposed. After treating RNA sample with DMS, reverse transcription(RT) is used to map the pattern of the modification, as when RT enzyme encounters a modifed nucleotide (A or C), it will introduces a mutation at that position, can be detected by assay and sequencing.

## P53
Tumor suppressor as transcription factor, the mutation of TP53 is one of the core mechanism in cancer, there are many target genes have been found that would interact with P53. 

## Autophagy
a celluar process triggered by stress and p53, the mTOR pathway is blocked, as the AMPK is activated, P53 further block mTOR activity through its target genes SESN1 and SESN2.

## mTOR
mTOR is a protein kinase, catalyzes the phosphorylation of proteins (AKT, IGF-1R etc), its dysregulation is related with several diseases. the stimulation of mTOR can increase tumor growth through multiple paths.
