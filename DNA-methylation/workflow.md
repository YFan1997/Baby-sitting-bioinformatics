# DNA methylation
## Bisulfite treatment 
In the experiment, we can use bisulfite treatment to detect the location of DNA methylation. The mechanism is that bisulfite treatment does not affect methylated cytosine (C-methy), but it converts unmethylated cytosine (C) to thymine (T). After sequencing, we can determine the methylation status by checking whether a base remains as cytosine (indicating methylation) or has been converted to thymine (indicating lack of methylation)
