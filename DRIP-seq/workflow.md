# DRIP-seq learning and analyze notes
### Yifan
## mechanism
DRIP stands for DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation, by directly obtain the sequence of DNA, researchers can further investigate R-loop mapping in the genome.


a monoclonal antibody, normally S9.6 antibody is usd to immunoprecipitate the R-loops, as this antibody could recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids,then non-specific DNA is washed away, leaving RNA-DNA enriched samples. By conducting amplification and standard library preparation, we can using sequencing to capature R-loops information in genome-wide. 


The sequencing data would go through the standard quality-check, alignment process, lastly conduct peak calling to identify regions of significant R-loop formation.
