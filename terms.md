# Teminologies in bioinformatics and genetics world
> this page is my notes of some terminologies, more focusing on biological aspect

## Cis-regulatory elements
DNA sequences, including enhancers, promoters located on the same chromosome as the gene they regulate, while trans occur when the regulatory elements come from a different chromosome or location.

## B cell
B cells are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in the immune system, can undergo a process called class-switch recombination, changes the type of antibody they produce.

## gene body
entire region of a gene, all the DNA sequences

## hybrid-binding domain
specific region or part of a protein that has the ability to recognaize and bind to hybrid structure.

## DMS for secondary structure
DMS is dimethyl sulfate, a chemical reagent reacting with A and C in single-stranded, provides information to check which bases are involved in base-pairing which are exposed. After treating RNA sample with DMS, reverse transcription(RT) is used to map the pattern of the modification, as when RT enzyme encounters a modifed nucleotide (A or C), it will introduces a mutation at that position, can be detected by assay and sequencing.
