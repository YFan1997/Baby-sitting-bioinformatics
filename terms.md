# Teminologies in bioinformatics and genetics world
> this page is my notes of some terminologies, more focusing on biological aspect

## Cis-regulatory elements
DNA sequences, including enhancers, promoters located on the same chromosome as the gene they regulate, while trans occur when the regulatory elements come from a different chromosome or location.

## B cell
B cells are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in the immune system, can undergo a process called class-switch recombination, changes the type of antibody they produce.

## gene body
entire region of a gene, all the DNA sequences

## hybrid-binding domain
specific region or part of a protein that has the ability to recognaize and bind to hybrid structure.
