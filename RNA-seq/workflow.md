# RNA-Seq 
RNA-seq is widely used next-generation sequencing method to determine the association between RNA and biosamples,
I will start from the wet lab process and then introduce a practical RNA-seq analyze procedure.

## wet lab process
> prepare samples, and extract RNA
in this step, researchers often use the ratios of 28s/18s ribosomal bands to estimates sample 
> 
> converting RNA to cDNA
